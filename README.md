# LeadsTracker_Per-borgen
An optimizable extension built especially for the sales representatives to help them gather information on the leads at the click of a button.

By developing this extension, I learnt the real-world usecase of JavaScript and intensified my scripting skills ðŸ˜ˆ

I learnt about :

1) the const variable uses
2) the localStorage function
3) the use of parameterized functions
4) difference between functions and arguments
5) cross page refresh
6) JSON : manifest.json
7) the parse and stringify functions


Hoping to learn a lot more ..I am grateful to Per Harald Borgen, the founder of scrimba.com and FreeCodeCamp for their comprehensive lecture of the topic from the beginner level.
